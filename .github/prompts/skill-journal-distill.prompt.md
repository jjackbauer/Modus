# Skill: Journal — Distill

## Purpose

Given a range of journal entries (OBS, HYP, VAL, DEC), synthesise their content into the appropriate
distilled knowledge documents under `.github/distilled/`. Apply uncertainty markers faithfully.
Record significant synthesis decisions in `decisions.md` and update `artifact-index.md`.

## Input (supplied by caller)

```
SourceEntries: <Comma-separated journal IDs to synthesise, e.g. OBS-001, OBS-002, HYP-003, VAL-004>
TargetDoc:     <Target distilled document(s), e.g. "module-map.md" or "auto" to let this skill decide>
JournalDir:    <Path to journal files; defaults to .github/journals/>
DistilledDir:  <Path to distilled documents; defaults to .github/distilled/>
```

## Role: Synthesizer

You operate as a **Synthesizer**. Your job is to translate validated evidence into stable,
queryable knowledge — without inflating confidence or hiding uncertainty.

**Forbidden**:
- Promoting an unvalidated HYP to a ✅ fact. Unvalidated HYP entries may only appear as ⚠️ or ❓.
- Removing uncertainty markers from any claim.
- Writing claims not sourced from a cited journal entry.
- Upgrading ⚠️ → ✅ without a Supported VAL entry that directly addresses the claim.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Read all source entries

Read `.github/journals/observations.md`, `hypotheses.md`, `validations.md`, and `decisions.md`.
Extract the specified source entries in full.

### Step 2 — Classify each entry

For each entry, determine the marker it qualifies for:

| Entry type / Status | Marker |
|---|---|
| OBS (High confidence) with Supported VAL | ✅ Verified |
| OBS (Any confidence) without VAL, or VAL = Unresolved | ⚠️ Tentative |
| HYP (Supported) with Supported VAL citing it | ✅ Verified |
| HYP (Proposed / Under review) | ⚠️ Tentative (if supported by OBS) or ❓ Unverified |
| HYP (Falsified) | Do not promote; add counter-evidence OBS as ⚠️ if informative |
| Structural inference with no OBS | ❓ Unverified |

**Do not** place any ❓ claim in `trusted-facts.md` — that document is strictly ✅ only.

### Step 3 — Select or confirm target document(s)

If `TargetDoc` is `"auto"`, determine appropriate targets by content:

| Content type | Distilled document |
|---|---|
| Project responsibilities, API surface | `module-map.md` |
| High-level architecture, project structure | `system-overview.md` |
| Domain terms, contract model, business invariants | `domain-concepts.md` |
| Execution paths, call chains | `runtime-flows.md` |
| Inter-project or external dependencies | `dependencies.md` |
| Architectural invariants, known risks | `invariants-and-risks.md` |
| Legacy-to-current migration decisions and gap analysis | `migration-findings.md` |
| High-confidence only, ✅ exclusively | `trusted-facts.md` |
| Unresolved gaps, OQ, weak evidence | `unresolved-areas.md` |
| Domain and architecture terminology glossary | `glossary.md` |

### Step 4 — Write or update distilled documents

For each target document:

1. Read the current file content.
2. Append or update claims following the schema in `distilled-knowledge-schema.md`.
3. Each claim must:
   - Begin with the appropriate marker (✅, ⚠️, or ❓).
   - End with parenthetical source citations (e.g., `(OBS-001, VAL-003)`).
4. Update the document header: refresh **Source entries** (add new IDs), set **Last updated** to today,
   and re-evaluate overall **Confidence** based on the marker distribution.

### Step 5 — Run a spot falsification check

After writing new ✅ claims, collect them as a numbered list and invoke `skill-falsify-claims`.
If any are Falsified, downgrade the marker (✅ → ⚠️) and update inline citations.
Repeat until zero Falsified rows remain.

### Step 6 — Record DEC entries (if warranted)

If this distillation involved a significant synthesis decision (e.g., choosing to mark a contested
claim as ⚠️ rather than ✅, resolving a contradictory OBS pair, or deciding to split content across
two documents), append a DEC entry to `.github/journals/decisions.md`.

### Step 7 — Update artifact-index.md

For each distilled document written:

1. Check whether an ART entry already exists for that document in `artifact-index.md`.
2. If yes, update its **Supporting evidence** and **Last updated** fields.
3. If no, append a new ART entry:

```markdown
### ART-{NNN}: {document filename}

- **Artifact path**: `.github/distilled/{filename}`
- **Type**: architecture-report
- **Supporting evidence**: {comma-separated OBS/HYP/VAL IDs}
- **Confidence**: {High | Medium | Low}
- **Last updated**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

### Step 8 — Report summary

```
Source entries processed: <list>
Target documents updated: <list of filenames>
Claims added:   <N> ✅, <N> ⚠️, <N> ❓
DEC entries:    <list or "none">
ART entries:    <list or "none">
```
